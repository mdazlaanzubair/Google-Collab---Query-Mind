# Query Mind - Testing a Pre-Trained QnA Model
 Welcome to the Query Mind repository! This project aims to test the performance of a pre-trained Question-Answering (QnA) model for a proposed application called Query Mind. The testing will be conducted on Google Colab, an online platform for running machine learning experiments.

## Getting Started
 To get started with this repository, you will need to have a Google account to access Google Colab. Once you have access to Google Colab, you can fork or clone this repository to your own Google Drive.

## The Query Mind Application
The Query Mind application aims to provide quick and accurate answers to user queries by leveraging the power of NLP and AI. The pre-trained QnA model will serve as the backbone of the application, processing user queries and returning the most relevant answers.

## Testing the Pre-Trained QnA Model
 This repository contains the testing script for the pre-trained QnA model. The script will evaluate the model's performance on a variety of questions and measure its accuracy in providing the correct answers. The testing results will be used to fine-tune the model and improve its overall performance.

## Contributing
 If you are interested in contributing to this project, feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue for discussion. We welcome all contributions that aim to improve the performance of the pre-trained QnA model.
